 <h2> Introduction ‚úÖ</h2>
 
  - Go to the following <a href="https://sokoban.poo-un.repl.co/"> <em> link </em> </a> to play the game.
  
  - Once you open the game, detailed instructions are given.
  
  - There are two different interfaces, in the settings menu you can choose between 6 available players, 11 unique sports and 6 levels for you to play. Once you press the play button, the fun begins (while playing you cannot adjust the settings mentioned at the beginning). 
  
  - There is a level that implements the classical maze game, try to find it.

 <h2> Key Implementation Details üõ†</h2>
 
  - JSON is used to create maps (<a href="https://github.com/cmartinezbo/POO-UNAL/blob/main/Sokoban/Resources/Maps/map1.json">here</a> you can find an example) and also to get every object position to allow either player and ball movement, it also allows every object to interact with each other.
  - There are visual and sound responses to user inputs, such as play/settings button and sliders.
  - There is music played according to play/settings interface.
  - If a sound starts playing in draw function of p5, the audio overlaps one on top of the other, according to each iteration of the loop. That's why a function is created to only work in the first loop of the draw function, so that the audios are played only once and this problem is solved.
  - There is a time andmMove counter that allows user to track his score on every attempt of a level. Once the user ends a level, a window prompt will show the final score while a win sound is played. 
  - Sokoban game mechanics allow level creation to make a maze map also, so there are 2 games in 1 (Sokoban and Maze).

<h2> Results üïπÔ∏è</h2>
  - You can find a mobile test of the game <a href="https://github.com/cmartinezbo/POO-UNAL/blob/main/Sokoban/Test/Mobile Test">here</a>.

 <h2> Future Features üîú</h2>
 
  - We will implement a scoreboard where you will find the best scores for each map.
  - We are going to develop and design more maps, levels, characters, sounds and personalization.
  - Our plan is that you could play with your friends by cross-platform (PC and mobile), also you will be able to play with your friends offline (Multiplayer).
  - Even that game board adjust to the size of the window of your current page, we want to improve user interface to proper adjust every object position (such as button and sliders), so there is a better user interface in every device you play at.


 <h2> Creator's Scoreboard üèÜ</h2>
  - You can find our scoreboard for the first 4 levels <a href="https://github.com/cmartinezbo/POO-UNAL/blob/main/Sokoban/Creator's Scoreboard">here</a>, try to beat us.
